This code retrieves character data from a server and displays it on a webpage. The data is retrieved using a fetch call to a URL and converted to a JSON format.
 The retrieved characters' names are added to a character bar on the webpage. 
 When a character name is clicked, their details are displayed in a detailed info section, including their name, image, and vote count.
  Users can vote for a character by entering a number in a form, and the character's vote count will be updated.
   Users can also reset a character's vote count to zero by clicking a reset button.
